# websitecrawl

This is a website crawler that I build using Python library Selenium

The purpose of this program is to access https://www.supremenewyork.com/ and find the items that users want to purchase.

Beside Selenium, this project also used Python UI builder PYQT5 to provide a better user experience.

Even though this project is pretty much finished but I still plans to make a major change to this project by implementing Scrapy library instead of Selenium. This is because I found Scrapy will allow for a much better run times in this case.
